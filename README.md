# bald-women-dataset
This hair loss dataset provides alopecia images of women captured from the top and front sides, labeled into three classes based on the Ludwig scale, with metadata (age, gender, ethnicity) to support machine learning, deep learning, and AI models for hair loss detection, early diagnosis, and research on hair thinning and scalp health.
